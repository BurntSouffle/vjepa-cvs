# Experiment 10c: Lower Learning Rate for Longer Training
# ========================================================
# Based on Exp10 which peaked at epoch 2 then declined.
# Try lower LR to train longer without overfitting.
#
# Changes from Exp10:
#   - lora_lr: 1e-4 -> 5e-5 (halved)
#   - head_lr: 5e-4 -> 2.5e-4 (halved)
#   - epochs: 15 -> 20 (more epochs)
#   - warmup_epochs: 2 -> 3 (longer warmup)
#   - patience: 5 -> 7 (allow more exploration)

  name: "exp10c_lora_lowlr"
  description: "Lower LR to train longer without overfitting"
  hypothesis: >
    Exp10 peaked at epoch 2 and declined after, suggesting LR was too high.
    Halving the LR should allow more gradual learning and potentially
    better final performance without early overfitting.
  baseline: "exp10_lora (53.75% mAP at epoch 2, declined after)"
